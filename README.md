# I made my own HTTP server

## Technologies used
- NodeJs -> Runtime environment

## Significance of this project
I built this HTTP server as a fun side project for me to get a deeper understanding of network traffic and how servers work. 
And that is exactly what I have gained from implementing this project.

This server can route GET and POST requests successfully and respond properly. 
In addition to that, one advanced feature is that I have applied logic to deliver logic using gzip compression too.

Overall I have learnt alot about requests, servers, response, headers, structure of a request or a response and much more.
